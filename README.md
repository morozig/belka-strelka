# Belka & Strelka

Made with Unity for my friends. Inspired by [Chicken Invaders 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qltko9YkL5s) and [Triangles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbenISPchiM).

Team up with your close one and save our planet in this short and simple game! Or if you are up for a challenge try controlling both ships yourself with WASD and a mouse. The catch is that all sectors attack only counterclockwise neighbour. And bonuses can be shared by leaving them.
